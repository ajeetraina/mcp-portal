# Categories Directory

This directory contains information about MCP servers organized by functionality categories. Each HTML file represents a different category and lists the MCP servers available in that category.

## File Naming Convention

Files are named using a kebab-case version of the category name followed by `.html` extension:

- `transportation.html` - Transportation MCP servers
- `government.html` - Government MCP servers
- `weather.html` - Weather MCP servers
- etc.

## Adding a New Category

To add a new category to the directory, create a new HTML file named after the category in kebab-case, following the template of existing files.

Additionally, update the `../data/mcp-servers.json` file with the category's information.

## Category Icons

Each category has an associated emoji icon for visual identification. When adding a new category, choose an appropriate emoji that best represents the category's function.

## Contributing Guidelines

Please see the main [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for instructions on how to contribute new categories or MCP servers to this directory.
