# Welcome to the Model Context Protocol

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables AI assistants like Claude to access external tools and services in a structured and standardized way. This section will guide you through the basics of MCP and help you get started with implementing it in your projects.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a communication protocol that allows AI models to interact with external tools. It was introduced by Anthropic and enables Claude to use a wide range of capabilities, from browsing the web to accessing databases and generating images.

MCP provides a standardized way for AI assistants to:

- Discover available tools
- Send requests to external services
- Process responses from those services
- Incorporate the information into their responses

## Why Use MCP?

MCP extends the capabilities of AI models beyond what they can do on their own:

- **Access to real-time data**: Connect to databases, APIs, and other information sources
- **Perform actions**: Allow AI to interact with external systems
- **Specialized processing**: Enable complex calculations, image generation, and other tasks
- **Enhanced user experience**: Create more capable AI assistants that can solve a wider range of problems

## Getting Started with MCP

To begin working with MCP, we recommend the following steps:

1. [Set up a basic MCP environment](/labs/01-getting-started/README.html)
2. [Learn about MCP servers and how they work](/categories/mcp-servers/)
3. [Explore available MCP tools](/categories/mcp-tools/)
4. [Try running your first MCP application](/labs/01-getting-started/README.html)

## MCP Architecture

MCP operates using a client-server architecture:

- **MCP Client**: The AI model (such as Claude) that sends requests to MCP servers
- **MCP Server**: A service that handles requests from the AI model and performs specific functions
- **MCP Gateway/Proxy**: An optional component that routes requests to appropriate servers

The protocol defines a standard format for these communications, ensuring compatibility between different implementations.

## Next Steps

Once you understand the basics, you can:

- [Build custom MCP servers](/labs/02-custom-mcp-server/README.html)
- [Integrate MCP with databases](/labs/03-database-integration/README.html)
- [Explore advanced use cases](/categories/advanced/)
- [Contribute to the MCP ecosystem](/CONTRIBUTING.html)
