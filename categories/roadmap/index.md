## Learning Phases Breakdown

### Beginner Level (Day 0-7)

Start your journey by understanding the fundamental concepts of MCP and how it works:

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Basic programming knowledge
   - Understanding of APIs
   - Docker basics
   - Terminal/Command line familiarity
   - JSON basics

2. **MCP Fundamentals**
   - What is MCP and why it matters
   - How MCP differs from function calling
   - How AI assistants integrate with MCP
   - Common MCP use cases
   - Setting up your first MCP environment

3. **MCP Architecture**
   - The client-server model in MCP
   - Message format and structure
   - JSON schema definition and usage
   - Communication flow between components
   - Error handling in MCP systems

### Intermediate Level (Day 8-21)

Build on your foundation by working with MCP servers and creating your own tools:

1. **Basic MCP Servers**
   - Working with time server
   - Using fetch server for web content
   - Filesystem server for local files
   - Ask Gordon CLI integration
   - Authentication basics

2. **Tools & Integration**
   - Creating JSON schemas for tools
   - Testing tool functionality
   - Tool documentation best practices
   - Orchestrating multiple tools
   - Building your first custom MCP tool

3. **Advanced Integration**
   - Database connections with MCP
   - External API integrations
   - Building RAG systems for document Q&A
   - Middleware development
   - Security and authentication patterns

### Advanced Level (Day 22-60+)

Master advanced concepts and build production-ready systems:

1. **Building AI Agents**
   - Agent architecture design
   - Creating multi-step workflows
   - Multimodal AI integration
   - Task planning and execution
   - Memory and context management

2. **Production & Deployment**
   - Containerization strategies
   - Kubernetes deployment
   - Performance optimization
   - Monitoring and logging
   - Security hardening

3. **Expert Topics**
   - Custom protocol extensions
   - Advanced security patterns
   - Building large-scale systems
   - Compliance and governance
   - Contributing to the MCP ecosystem

## Project Milestones

As you progress through your MCP learning journey, complete these milestone projects to reinforce your knowledge:

1. **Beginner Milestone**: Build a simple MCP server that provides current time and basic calculations.
2. **Intermediate Milestone**: Create a document Q&A system that connects to a database and retrieves relevant information.
3. **Advanced Milestone**: Develop an autonomous AI agent that can execute multi-step tasks across different data sources.
