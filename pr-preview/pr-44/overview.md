# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Overview

## What is the Model Context Protocol?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that provides a universal way to connect AI models and agentic applications to various data sources and tools. It enables AI applications to supply context (documents, database records, API data, web search results, etc.) to AI models.

MCP follows a client-server model with clear separation of roles. An MCP Host (the AI application or agent) connects via an MCP Client library to one or more MCP Servers. Each server exposes a specific set of capabilities (such as reading files, querying a database, or calling an API) through a standardized protocol.

This is why people often refer to MCP as the "USB-C port for AI applications" - it creates a standardized interface for AI models to interact with external tools and data sources.

## Key Components of MCP

1. **MCP Host**: The AI application or agent that needs to use external tools
2. **MCP Client**: Library that handles communication between the host and servers
3. **MCP Servers**: Components that expose specific capabilities through the protocol

## Why MCP Matters

MCP solves several critical challenges in AI application development:

1. **Standardization**: Creates a unified way for AI models to interact with external tools
2. **Extensibility**: Makes it easy to add new capabilities to AI systems
3. **Security**: Provides defined points where security controls can be applied
4. **Interoperability**: Enables different AI models to work with the same tools

## Core Benefits

- **Tool Integration**: Connect AI models to databases, APIs, file systems, and other services
- **Context Enrichment**: Provide additional information and data to improve AI responses
- **Agentic Capabilities**: Enable AI systems to perform complex, multi-step tasks using external tools
- **Developer Ecosystem**: Create and share reusable tools across different AI applications

## Security Considerations

While MCP is powerful, it also requires careful security implementation:

- **Authentication & Authorization**: Ensuring only authorized access to sensitive data
- **Data Security**: Protecting information in transit and at rest
- **Input Validation**: Guarding against malicious inputs or prompt injection
- **Monitoring**: Tracking AI interactions with external tools and data sources
